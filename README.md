# Expo ImagePicker Issue on Android

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using Expo's ImagePicker component on specific Android devices. The ImagePicker fails to function correctly, preventing users from selecting images from their gallery or camera.

## Bug Description

The ImagePicker component becomes unresponsive or throws errors when attempting to pick an image. This is not consistent across all Android devices; some devices work without any issues. The root cause is currently unknown but may relate to inconsistencies in Android's image selection APIs or permissions management.

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the project on an Android device exhibiting the problem.
3. Attempt to select an image using the ImagePicker component.
4. Observe the unresponsive behavior or error messages.

## Solution

A potential solution involves using a different image picker library or implementing custom image selection logic with platform-specific code. A workaround is to explicitly request permissions and handle potential errors gracefully.

## Additional Notes

* The bug is device-specific, meaning it may not reproduce on all Android devices.
* The exact error message varies depending on the device and Android version.
* Further investigation is required to determine the underlying cause of the problem.
